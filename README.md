# Flight-Delays-and-Cancellation

## Introduction
In this project, create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. Create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. The work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Dataset
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of [2015 flight delays and cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays).
